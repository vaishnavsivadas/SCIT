# SCIT
## Task 1

### 1. 

The program Poisson.py generates 3 random data sets with a size 1000, produced by the np.random.poisson() function in the numpy library of python and it also generates the graphs which plots the histograms for the same. The value given for lambda is 6.

##### Graphs

Eventhough the 3 graphs are similar, they do not form a bell curve. (Since poisson distribution is followed)



### 2. 

The program Normal.py generates 3 random data sets with a size 1000, produced by the np.random.normal() function in the numpy library of python and it also generates the graphs which plots the histograms for the same. The value given for Mean and Sigma(Standard Deviation) is 1 and 0.1 respectively.

![Normal Graph 3](https://github.com/vaishnavsivadas/SCIT/blob/master/Task%201/Graphs/Normal/Normal%202.png)

Eventhough each graph differ slightly, the peak of all the three graphs are near the mean and all the three graphs form a bell curve. (Since Normal distribution is followed)


### 3.

The program Average.py generates the histogram of 100 random points choosen from np.random.poisson() and np.random.normal() functions, 100 times and plots the graphs of the same, together.

#### Graphs

From this graph, it can be inferred that all the 100 experiments tends to produce an identical result i.e., the histogram generated for each experiments are similar.
